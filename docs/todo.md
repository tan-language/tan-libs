# Todo

- consider renaming the workspace:
  - tan-library-impl
  - tan-library-foreign
  - tan-dyn-libs <--
- remove the `lib-` prefix from crates.
- find better coding convention instead of foreign-core

### Done

- build (and install) release version of crates.
- create workspace, set versions in workspace.
