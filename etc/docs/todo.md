# Todo

- remove the `lib-` prefix from crates.
- find better coding convention instead of foreign-core
- lib-js-compiler (transpiler)
- lib-rust-compiler (transpiler)

### Done

- build (and install) release version of crates.
- create workspace, set versions in workspace.
- consider renaming the workspace:
  - tan-library-impl
  - tan-library-foreign
  - tan-dyn-libs <--
